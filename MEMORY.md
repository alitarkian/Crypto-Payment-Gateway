## Known Patterns & Invariants

### Payment Flow
1. `MultiChainWatcher` detects on-chain tx → builds `ProcessPayment` command
2. `PaymentUseCase::process()` checks duplicate signature in DB
3. Saves payment with status `Detected`, immediately calls `confirm()` → status `Confirmed`
4. Marks invoice as `Paid`, creates `Settlement`, emits `invoice.paid` webhook event

### Blockchain field propagation
`DetectedPayment` carries both `blockchain` (e.g. `"solana"`, `"ethereum"`) and `asset` (e.g. `"USDC"`).
These are passed through `ProcessPayment` → `Payment::new()` and stored in DB.
Do NOT hardcode blockchain or asset in domain constructors.

### API Key format
Format: `cgpk_<64-char lowercase hex>` (256-bit OsRng entropy, total 69 chars)
Old UUID-based format (`mk_...`) is deprecated — existing keys in DB remain valid.

### seen_signatures seeding
`MultiChainWatcher` seeds `seen_signatures` from DB on startup via
`PaymentRepository::find_signatures_by_blockchain()`.
This prevents redundant RPC calls after service restart.
Duplicate-payment protection is enforced at DB level regardless.

### Wallet Types
Two types of wallets exist:
1. **Watch Wallet** (`POST /api/v1/wallets`) — merchant provides their own address. System monitors it.
2. **Managed Wallet** (`POST /api/v1/wallets/generate`) — system generates keypair, encrypts private key, returns only the address.

### Managed Wallet Key Storage
- Private keys stored in `wallet_keys` table as AES-256-GCM ciphertext
- Master key from `WALLET_MASTER_KEY` env var (64-char hex = 32 bytes)
- `key_version` column enables future key rotation
- `WalletVault` is the ONLY service allowed to decrypt keys
- Private key is NEVER returned in API responses, NEVER logged
- In production, missing `WALLET_MASTER_KEY` causes panic at startup

### Supported Blockchains + Key Types
| Blockchain | Key Type | Address Format |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| Solana | ed25519 | Base58 (32-44 chars) |
| Ethereum / Polygon / Base / BSC | secp256k1 | `0x` + 20-byte hex |
| Tron | secp256k1 | Base58Check, starts with `T`, 34 chars |
| Bitcoin | secp256k1 | P2PKH Base58Check, starts with `1` |

### Supported Assets
| Asset | Chains | Decimals |
|-------|--------|----------|
| USDC | Solana, Ethereum, Polygon, Base | 6 |
| USDT | Tron (TRC-20), BSC (BEP-20) | 6 |
| SOL | Solana | 9 |
| ETH | Ethereum | 18 |
| BNB | BSC | 18 |
| TRX | Tron | 6 |
| BTC | Bitcoin | 8 |

### Active Chain Adapters
| Chain | Adapter | Config Env Vars |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| Solana | SolanaAdapter | `SOLANA_RPC_URL`, `SOLANA_USDC_MINT` |
| Ethereum | EthereumAdapter | `ETHEREUM_RPC_URL`, `ETHEREUM_USDC_CONTRACT` |
| BSC | BscAdapter | `BSC_RPC_URL`, `BSC_TOKEN_CONTRACT`, `BSC_TOKEN_SYMBOL` |
| Tron | TronAdapter | `TRON_RPC_URL`, `TRON_TOKEN_CONTRACT`, `TRON_TOKEN_SYMBOL` |

All adapters are optional — only enabled when env vars are set.

### Rust 2024 Edition Gotchas (confirmed fixes)
- `std::env::set_var` is unsafe → wrap in `unsafe {}`
- Temporaries in array literals (`.to_string()` reference) cause type inference failures → hoist to variable first
- `aes-gcm` nonce: use `Aes256Gcm::generate_nonce(&mut OsRng)` (not deprecated `from_slice`)
- `reqwest 0.13` `.query()` method not always available → build URL query string manually
- `secp256k1 v0.29` feature is `hashes` not `bitcoin_hashes`

### TODO markers
* `TODO(phase-13)` — block-confirmation oracle: replace immediate `confirm()` call
  in `PaymentUseCase::process()` with N-confirmation wait before confirming.
* `TODO(future)` — migrate `WalletVault` master key to AWS KMS or HashiCorp Vault for HSM-grade security.
* `TODO(future)` — Bitcoin monitoring adapter (Blockstream API or Bitcoin Core RPC).
